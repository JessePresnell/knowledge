As evidenced by
[this FOIA request for logs of the USTR](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/visitor-logs-for-ustr-1437/#686130-visitor-log-february-1-to-february-28-2011),
we run the risk of getting hand written logs. OCR and record linkage
might be able to link these up, but it could be pretty rough going.

Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFS) have vistor
logs, as
[evidenced by this manual](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/510521m_vol2.pdf). [SCIF's are super special rooms for working with super secret information](http://www.armagcorp.com/products/scifs/a-r-c-vault-scifs/?gclid=CJLc6cv_0b4CFYMGOgodZAcAJw).

``` Visit Certifications. Each SCIF will have written procedures for
identifying and controlling visitors and will maintain a visitor log
with the following information: name of visitor, organization, citi
zenship, purpose of visit, POC, and date/time of the visit. Visitor
logs shall be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.” Retain visitor logs for
1 year after the date of the last entry.
